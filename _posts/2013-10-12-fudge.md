CADS Freshers' Uniquely Diabolically Genuinely Excellent Show

For the entertainment of Christ’s Freshers, CADS presents their Freshers’ uniquely diabol… their FUDGE Show! This will be a most delectable selection of sketches and stand up written and preformed by some of Christ's very own! Headlining a great stand up comedian Jamie Fraser - one of the staple stand ups from Cambridge. Not only will this be a hilarious and fun event to go to before the infamous family dinners, but it also won’t cost you a penny! That’s right, it’s free! However we will have a donation bucket collection at the end and all money raised will go to charity.
We will definitely not be providing fudge though, as there is a no eating, no drinking policy in the theatre. Not because we ate it all. No sirree.
