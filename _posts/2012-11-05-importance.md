The Importance of Being Earnest - a trivial comedy for serious people. A farce of miscommunication, misguided lovers, and a misplaced handbag. The serious Jack Worthing and the audacious Algernon Moncrieff both adopt the fashionable name Ernest to get their dream girl, but there are still the relatives to deal with.
