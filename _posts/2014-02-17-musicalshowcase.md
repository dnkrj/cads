Come one, come all to CADS's first ever Musical Theatre Showcase! Enjoy a nice relaxing evening of Musical Theatre in Yusuf Hamied Theatre with songs from the likes of Wicked, Les Misérables, Frozen, Avenue Q and more!

Your Week 5 entertainment may have begun with the likes of Mean Girls at Christ's Films and you may be thinking of heading to Week 5 Blues (If that is indeed going ahead) later in the week, but, start your week with the magic of musicals!
