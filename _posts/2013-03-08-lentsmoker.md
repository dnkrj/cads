After such a success last year, CADS is putting on another Christ's Holy Smoker! Again we promise no burning of any of the holy works, but instead a enjoyable night of hilarity. Last year we had a mix of stand up and sketches and a wondeful audience (I'd give that audience 5 stars). And for only £3 you just can't afford not to come.

Compère - Zoe Tomalin
