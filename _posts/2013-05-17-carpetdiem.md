Seize the day! Seize the carpet! Wait, that’s not right – this is a standup show, not a fun on the floor free-for-all - Get up! Continue seizing the day!

Siân Docksey and Zoë Tomalin bring their genre-defying comedy show to the ADC for one night of unparalleled linoleum fun. Joined by the fantastic Adrian Gray and Oli Marsh, as well as a MYSTERY GUEST, this is a carpet not to be missed. Brilliant, bewildering and grit-resistant – an explosive (con)fusion of standup, poetry, music, special guests, lighting and jam. Described as 'hugely funny' (Varsity), 'genuinely hilarious' (The Tab) and 'funnier than they had any right to be' (The Cambridge Student), spruce up the shag piles and roll out the rugs for a fearless comedy romp.

All proceeds donated to Flack, Cambridge.
