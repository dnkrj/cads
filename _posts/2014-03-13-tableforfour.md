Owen is ready for another week of parties and procrastination when he finds out that his parents are arriving that evening for dinner, under the impression that he has booked a restaurant and that they will meet his new girlfriend. Will Owen pull off the greatest deception of Lent term? Will he find love in the back room of Curry Queen? And will the whole thing be derailed by a bad French accent? 

CADS present the 2014 Christ's College Freshers' Play, written by Paul Tait and Alasdair McNab
