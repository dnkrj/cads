A sketch show, appearing and unravelling before your eyes. 

Tucked away in a cramped and decrepit old attic, two writers keep the cobwebs, sleep, and reality at bay. But through the caffeine-induced haze, things start to come alive. And once ideas are released, they tend to take centre-stage; when they start to fight, well, writer’s block is the least of your worries...

Creative control takes on a whole new meaning.
