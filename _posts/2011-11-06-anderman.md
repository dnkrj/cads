A new play to be performed this term, "Anderman" tells the story of Joseph Anderman. He's brilliant – a visionary – a genius. Or so people say. But what’s certain is he only has a few months to live. 

He’s not alone, of course. He has loyal friends, devoted followers and a girlfriend who adores him. What he wants, though, is to create a work of art that will outlast him: that will allow him to live on in the minds of others.

He will cast away every kind word, every caring glance, and exploit his closest friends. His urge to achieve is obsessive – insatiable – and with his time running out he will do anything to succeed. He’s more than willing to destroy in order to create.
