Comedy pear Siân Docksey and Zoë Tomalin lavishly invite you into their topsy turvy world of glitter, cardboard, and small but significant amounts of arterial blood. With successful flora/fauna into radio, standup, and theatre, Siân and Zoë bring their unique frothy blend of glitzy carefully-jumbled madness into a week-long party rumble (may contain gluten). Itʼs the creme de la crumb of kitsch irreverence, lightly battered in a sparkly crust of cool. Cool is imperative. Everybody be cool. And bring your friends. And your pets. Yes.
