7pm, Mon 4th - Tue 5th Mar 2013 @ Christ's New Court Theatre

This year's Christ's College Freshers' Play is a brand new comedy written by our very own Adrian Gray (most famous for his Footlights Smokers appearances) and George Lord (a classicist- oh the inevitable puns..)

Bad Information promises to be a witty and exciting farce - written, directed and acted entirely by Christ's freshers. And as if that wasn't enough, it contains anything up to six jokes, a prat fall and some snogging. Win!
