CADS present the first hypnotism show to hit the Cambridge theatre scene: The Hypnotist. For one night only, witness the power of The Hypnotist as you lose the ability to remember your own name, or even speak in your own language, but acquire the ability to speak a new one. This ADC One Night Stand promises to blow away sceptics and believers alike.

In accordance wih the Hypnotism Act of 1952, it is prohibited for persons under the age of 18 to attend hypnotism performances. This performance is therefore only suitable for 18+.
